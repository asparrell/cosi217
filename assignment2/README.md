# COSI217 Assignment 2
Annika Sparrell
## Run Instructions
### Requirements
Python version 3.10

Packages:
* `spacy`
* `flask`
* `Flask-SQLAlchemy`
* `typing_extensions=4.8.0`


Run the main module in `app_flask.py` from your IDE. You should see a script that states that the flask server is now running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 . 
Navigate to this port on your browser, and you should be able to access the site.* Either use the default input or type your own text to be processed,
select whether you would like to see the formatted results or what is stored in the database, and hit submit. You can return to the form at any time by clicking "Back to form".

*There is a strange issue where sometimes it will say "Access to localhost was denied. You don't have authorization to view this page". It is unclear what causes this; try force reloading if it occurs.
